- `all_ten.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for finding and analyzing the All-Ten game.
- `concatenated_only.txt`: List of all starting number combinations that have at least one target number with solutions possible only with the concatenation operation (&).
- `duplicates.txt`: Analysis of the different versions of the main functions that had problems with duplicate solutions.
- `least_solutions.txt`: List of all starting number combinations ordered by the total number of solutions over all target values.
- `non_valid_starts.txt`: List of all starting number combinations that don't have a solution for at least one of the target numbers - unsolvable.
